[AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) directive for creating "starrating" form fields

## Examples
comming soon 

## Documentation

Still working on it.

## Getting started/How to use it

Include the `starRating` dependency on your Angular module:
```
var app = angular.module('demoapp', ['starRating']);
```

After that, you are ready. Just define an object with the basic configuration (`ng-model`, and `data-ratingsubject`) and a default five star 10 level rating will be rendered.
